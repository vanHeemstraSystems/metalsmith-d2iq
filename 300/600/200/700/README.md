# 700 - Wrapping Up

If you've made it this far, congratulations!

You’ve accomplished everything we’ve set out to do. You have successfully…

1. Set up your project folder and all the necessary files.
2. Installed your requirements
3. Created some source content.
4. Created a page template.
5. Created a node script using the Metalsmith API to run your content through the two required steps we identified at the outset.
6. Run your script in Node and found the results in the ```build``` folder.
7. Created a *metalsmith.json* file that runs through the exact same Metalsmith plugins and settings.
8. Run the CLI version of Metalsmith, reading your configuration from *metalsmith.json* and doing the exact same task.

You’ll find that you can continue to add content, if so desired, to the *src/* folder. Each and every source markdown file that you add will create yet another HTML file in the build directory with the same path (aside from having a .html extension instead of .md).
